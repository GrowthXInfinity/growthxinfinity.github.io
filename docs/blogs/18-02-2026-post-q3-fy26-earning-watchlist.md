## 📈 What Matters Post Earnings

Post Q3, focus shifts to:
- FY26 guidance vs delivery
- Margin sustainability
- Capex intensity vs cash flow
- Debt trajectory
- Order book execution
- Working capital cycle

Price alone does not determine opportunity.  
Earnings durability does.

---

## ⚖️ Portfolio Allocation Framework

Structured monitoring approach:
- Core compounders → Strong ROCE + steady earnings
- Tactical growth → Expansion-led stories
- High beta bets → MSME / early-stage operators
- Yield stabilisers → InvITs / infra cash flow plays

Rebalancing must be thesis-driven, not price-driven.

---

## 🔍 Final Take

Q3 FY26 provided clarity across sectors.

The next 2–3 quarters will differentiate:
- Narratives vs numbers
- Guidance vs execution
- Expansion vs returns

A disciplined watchlist is not about tracking prices.  
It is about tracking business performance.
